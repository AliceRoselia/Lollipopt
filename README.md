# Lollipopt.jl

Lean, Optimizable, Leverageable LInear Programming OPTimizer.

Lollipopt is a shell repository that may one day become an open-contribution Mixed-Integer programming solver.

We realize that the best way to solve the problem might be to combine the problem-specific insight, the meaning of the problem, with the insights gained from the LP formulation of the problem. Therefore, users are encouraged to fork the repository if they want to add problem-specific optimizations to the task. We intend to make it easy to do so.

The programming language of choice is Julia, home to one of the best optimization ecosystem, JuMP.jl

Stage 1: Kickstart the project: Get at least a minimal solver as well as a test set and the evaluation program ready.

Stage 2: Optimization: We will optimize the hell out of

Contributions are welcome. I will gladly review pull requests and even test your code.

If you want to kickstart the project, welcome. Otherwise, this repository shall remain a shell repository.
